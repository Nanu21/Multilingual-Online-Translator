# Multilingual-Online-Translator

I did this project when I was learning WEB-SCRAPING on the JETBRAINS ACADEMY

In this project you are going input user_language = your language, translator_language = language you want to translate to, and word = word for the translation
There are 13 languages available for tanslation


--> A text file would be created on the system named same as word in which output would be saved
--> Using input a url would be created
--> The connection would be statbilished with the site
--> The program will search for the word on the website "https://context.reverso.net/translation/"
--> If the response from the site is Success!
--> The program will then fetch the output from the website and save the output in the reqd format in the file created
--> If there are errors like ConnectionError or AttributeError specific output displating the error would be printed
--> If everything works fine then the program reads the file and prints the result on the terminal screnn.
--> Thus ending the program!

The path for the main code is: Multilingual Online Translator > task > translator > translator.py
